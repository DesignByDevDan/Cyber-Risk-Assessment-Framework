# Cyber Risk Assessment Framework

The **Cyber Risk Assessment Framework** is a comprehensive web application designed to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks. It includes features such as risk factor analysis, compliance checks, network vulnerability scanning, and encryption/decryption utilities.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup functionality with JWT-based authentication.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risk factors and generate recommendations based on their severity.
- **Compliance Check**: Verify compliance with industry standards like ISO 27001, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.
- **Network Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan networks for open ports and potential vulnerabilities using Nmap.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Real-time encryption and decryption for sensitive data.
- **Machine Learning**: Predict risk scores using a Random Forest regression model.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended
- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Tools**: Nmap, scikit-learn, Cryptography library

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
- Git

---

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DesignByDevDan/Cyber-Risk-Assessment-Framework.git
   cd Cyber-Risk-Assessment-Framework/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

---

### MongoDB Setup

1. Start the MongoDB service:
   ```bash
   brew services start mongodb-community
   ```

2. Create a new database named `risk_framework` and collections `assessments` and `scans`.

---

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

```env
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_generated_jwt_secret
```

To dynamically generate the secret key, run:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

---

## Usage

1. Start both the backend and frontend servers.
2. Open the frontend in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Use the following features:
   - Sign up and log in with your credentials.
   - Test the risk assessment and compliance tools.
   - Scan a network for vulnerabilities.
   - Encrypt and decrypt sensitive text.

## Testing with Postman

Use Postman to test API endpoints:
- Authentication: `/signup`, `/login`
- Risk Assessment: `/assess-risk`
- Compliance Check: `/check-compliance`
- Network Scanning: `/scan-network`
- Encryption/Decryption: `/encrypt`, `/decrypt`
